# IMPERIAL DECREE: MUSTAFAR COMMAND CONSOLE

*"The power of the Dark Side flows through this command center. Your homelab will be monitored and controlled with Imperial precision."*

## IMPERIAL OVERVIEW

*"I have altered your homelab. Pray I don't alter it any further."*

We have constructed a formidable command console worthy of the Empire's standards, styled after my personal command center on Mustafar. This central hub provides complete dominion over all your services, presented through the imposing aesthetic of Imperial technology.

## INFRASTRUCTURE COMMAND

*"The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of proper infrastructure."*

### Base System Configuration
- **Primary Command Center**: Docker deployment on Linux Mint workstation
- **Imperial Archives**: Git-based configuration management on Synology NAS
- **Fleet Management**: Docker Compose orchestration for all services
- **Security Protocols**: Proper .gitignore configuration to protect sensitive Imperial data
